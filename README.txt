VISUAL STUDIO IS REQUIRED!!!

Either the freely avaible VS2022, or older versions such as VS2019 \ VS2015 have to be installed before proceeding any further.
An IDE is required for the modding process to properly continue.

The 2019 version, as to my knowledge is no longer avaible on the web, theres still recovered versions of it on piracy websites. VS2015 however, is included in this package, along with the required tools. (Internet archive link for the regular VS2015, and vstu2015 for the unity tools.)
I reccommend downloading the 2022 version of VS instead of the older ones, but im not forcing you to.

THIS KIT MAY NOT BE UP TO MODERN STANDARTS!!!

Some (or even most) of these tools may be outdated or not even functioning at all, since i was just scouring the internet for modding tools of all kinds.

I will thank anybody that improves the modding kit to make it actually work, so that future modders can improve on their works.
